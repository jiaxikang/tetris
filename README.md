# tetris
Tetris game run on python.

Controls are:
'left, right' arrow keys to move left and right
'up' arrow key to rotate clockwise
'down' arrow key to fast fall
'space' for instant fall
'p' for toggling pause

Goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are accumulated when a row of tetriminos are cleared. As more rows are cleared, the level increases, and the speed of falling will also increase. 

GAME OVER when tetris piece hits the roof.
